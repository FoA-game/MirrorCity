## MC A - Paradise Lost

This is a city steeped in the twilight of yesteryears. Following the Second Great Disruption, the grand city of Artica was reduced to ashes. Yet, its survivors, driven by nostalgia, endeavored to resurrect the city on the northern side of the canyon. However, the incomplete museums and shattered galleries seemed to mock their efforts, ridiculing their futile and impractical attempt—The splendor of Artica had been whisked away by the winds of time, leaving in its wake merely a fractured mirror—a poignant reflection of human arrogance and grief.

As Nuovartica rose from the ruins of Artica, the White Tower Council stripped the city of its original name, dubbing it Mirror City. This land became a sanctuary for those ghosts cast aside by the new world: artists, poets, writers, historians, anthropologists... Once, perhaps, they have been unmatched in skill and basked in glory, yet in this reshaped world, they are labeled merely as "the useless," their talents considered obsolete, their convictions insignificant.

Those who refuse to embrace change, who shy away from practical endeavors, or who offer no tangible contributions to society are being slowly consigned to oblivion. If they persist in clinging to the dimming embers of a bygone era, this city will inevitably stand as their final epitaph.


## MC B - Call from Afar

Dear Zacena,

We received the projection card of the blue and white porcelain vase you restored, and it is a true beauty. The kids and I miss you every day, especially at night when they keep asking when mom will be home.

You're doing great work with the Alexandria Archives Association, and I truly admire your passion and dedication. But dear, I can't help but wonder, what value do all these ancient artifacts hold in our world full of dangers? The demand in our world is increasingly for practical technologies, and those old items don't seem to bring much to the table. I know this might sound a bit direct, but today's news even referred to you and your colleagues as AAA scavengers.

Your younger brother, Jela, has become a mechanical engineer at Fortress, and the whole family is proud of him. His achievements are beneficial to society and allow him to support himself and his family. In contrast, your choices seem to have led you in a different direction.

I'm not trying to tell you what to do, dear, just that I wish we had more money and time to make our home more complete.

Hoping to hear your voice soon. Take care, we all love you and miss you here.

Forever yours, <br>
Chad


## MC C - Art Critic

The "Latent Past" art exhibition grandly opened at La Fountain Inn yesterday. Solaris Kovacs, wielding remnants of video clips and critiques, breathed new life into the bygone film "Citizen Kane," offering a reinterpretation through particle projection, drama, and immersive installations. Zen Kaito applied an archaic form of stem cell technology to incorporate autologously cultured organs into the seats and dashboards of abandoned aericles...

However, the spectacle staged by these *restorists* scarcely garnered public attention, resembling more a festivity detached from reality. Though proclaimed by the artists as works of high skill and profound depth, the mysterious paintings, odd sculptures, obscure poems, and cryptic novels remain enigmatic to the masses. These creations, too complex and esoteric, neither provide an aesthetic experience nor enlighten the soul... The focus of journalists and the public is drawn more towards pressing concerns, like the water source of La Fountain Inn and the basic life support for residents...

...Rumors that Nguyen Van, the head of the White Tower's Social Research Department, attended the exhibition and delivered a speech were quickly debunked. It was verified that the official was involved in a crucial data monitoring review meeting that day, briefly stepping away for less than an hour...


## MC D - Cache Cleanup

Humanity's vast cultural heritage once flowed ceaselessly into the digital oceans of the Internet, cradled within phomos — photon memory crystals — in servers until catastrophe struck. In an instant, the global internet vanished, and with it, the majority of these memory vessels were obliterated, casting invaluable creations and records into an abyss of loss. What remains are scattered phomos in data centers and yellowed books in museums.

Phomos, bearing the half-life of mere five years, stood on the brink of dissipating all they encompassed upon damage. Yet, amidst this precarious balance, the relentless pursuit of Fortress to solicit new crystals for the monumental task of civilization's reconstruction went insatiable. In these critical moments, where existence itself hung in the balance, scant were those who lingered to lament the slow fading of documentation and memory into oblivion.

Upper Nuovartica launched the Atlas Project, a pledge to weave the vital threads of water, power, and internet throughout Auroria. The ambitious endeavor demanded the sacrifice of phomos laden with text, images, and videos. Since these data were destined to fade, requisitioning the phomos from the New Bibliotheca Alexandrina seemed only natural. Fragments of old-world human civilization were thus doomed to fade into the ether, leaving no trace behind.


## MC E - Out of Reach

The "Venus de Milo" artist collective's proposal to the White Tower, advocating for the inclusion of history, literature, and art in the educational curriculum, faces rejection once more.

The old educational system has become a relic of history, supplanted by a curriculum that champions practicality and utility. In this new era, the focus has pivoted to essential fields such as materials science, civil engineering, and medicine—deemed foundational for the resurrection of civilization. The White Tower posits that this pragmatic education addresses communal obligations and equips individuals with the necessary skills to navigate and endure the aftermath of cataclysms.

The White Tower contends that in our era, besieged by crises, the pursuit of understanding humanity's history and the ability to appreciate and create art and literature—once seen as hallmarks of "civilization"—have lost their luster. If seeking entertainment, why not engage in physical sports to strengthen the body or use efficient, portable devices for emotional regulation? And for emotional expression, where can these creations find their audience when most people in this era are indifferent to artistic works? Though filled with the creators' emotions and thoughts, exhibitions at La Fountain Inn are criticized for their esoteric nature and disconnected from daily life.

In this era dominated by efficiency and practical orientation, the armless Vénus seems incapable of embracing the future.
