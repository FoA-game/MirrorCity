## MC A - Paradise Lost

This is a ghost steeped in the fading afterglow of yesteryear. Following the Second Great Disruption, the Grand City of Artica was reduced to ashes. Yet, its survivors clung desperately to the splendor of the past. Their futile efforts to resurrect the city on the northern edge of the canyon left behind only unfinished museums and crumbling galleries, as if silently mocking the hubris of humanity. The winds had long whisked away the brilliance of Artica, leaving behind nothing more than a fractured mirror reflecting the arrogance and sorrow of civilization.

Years later, when Nuovartica rose from the ruins of Artica, the White Tower Council stripped this replica of its original name and dubbed it Mirror City. This land became an exile for the ghosts cast aside by the new world: artists, poets, writers, historians, anthropologists... Once masters of their crafts and celebrated in their time, they are now scorned by the remade age as "the useless," their talents deemed obsolete, and their beliefs dismissed as illusions.

Those who refuse to embrace change, who shy away from practical endeavors, or who offer no tangible contributions to society are being slowly consigned to oblivion. If they persist in clinging to the dimming embers of a bygone era, this city is fated to stand as their shared graveyard.


## MC B - Call from Afar

Dear Zacena,

We received the projection card of the blue and white porcelain vase you restored, and it is a true beauty. The kids and I miss you every day, especially at night when they keep asking when Mom will be home.

You're doing great work with the Alexandria Archives Association, and I truly admire your passion and dedication. But dear, I can't help but wonder: What value do all these ancient artifacts hold in our world full of dangers? The world we live in today needs practical technology more than ever, and these relics don’t seem to address any pressing issues. I know this might sound a bit direct, but today's news even referred to you and your colleagues as "3A Scavengers."

Your younger brother, Jela, has become a mechanical engineer at Fortress, and the whole family is proud of him. His achievements are beneficial to society and allow him to support himself and his family. In contrast, your choices seem to have led you in a different direction.

I'm not trying to tell you what to do, dear; I just wish that we had more money and that the kids and I could be closer to you.

Hoping to hear your voice soon. Take care, we all love you and miss you here.

Forever yours, <br>
Chad


## MC C - Art Critic

The "Latent Past" art exhibition grandly opened at La Fountain Inn yesterday. Solaris Kovacs, wielding remnants of video clips and critiques, breathed new life into the bygone film "Citizen Kane," offering a reinterpretation through particle projection, drama, and immersive installations. Zen Kaito applied an archaic form of stem cell technology to incorporate autologously cultured organs into the seats and dashboards of abandoned aericles...

However, the spectacle staged by these *restorists* scarcely garnered public attention, resembling more a festivity detached from reality. Though proclaimed by the artists as works of high skill and profound depth, the mysterious paintings, odd sculptures, obscure poems, and cryptic novels remain enigmatic to the masses. These creations, too complex and esoteric, neither provide an aesthetic experience nor enlighten the soul... The focus of journalists and the public is drawn more towards pressing concerns, like the water source of La Fountain Inn and the basic life support for residents...

...Rumors that Nguyen Van, the head of the White Tower's Social Research Department, attended the exhibition and delivered a speech were quickly debunked. It was verified that the official was involved in a crucial data monitoring review meeting that day, briefly stepping away for less than an hour...


## MC D - Cache Cleanup

The vast cultural heritage of humanity once flowed endlessly into the digital oceans, condensing in the data centers as phomos — photon memory crystals. Words, sounds, images—threads that wove together millennia of thought and history—were once the most cherished treasures of human beings. Until disaster struck and civilization fell, countless memory vessels, like fallen stars, obliterated into the boundless darkness.

Yet, some are resisting oblivion. They became the librarians of the New Bibliotheca Alexandrina, standing watch over the remaining crystals and yellowed books day after day.

However, the photon crystals bear a half-life of mere fifteen years. Once damaged, everything they hold dissolves into microwaves, vanishing forever. Even with Fortress exhausting its resources to produce new crystals, it is far from sufficient to meet the demands of research and production critical for rebuilding civilization, leaving no room to address the needs of Mirror City: scarce resources, urgent priorities—few pauses to lament the documentations and creations slowly fading into nonexistence.

Now, Upper Nouvatica has decided to launch the Atlas Project, vowing to provide a new lifeline of water, electricity, and networks across Auroria. Yet, this ambitious endeavor demands a price—the phomos of Mirror City. Since these neglected data are destined to decay, requisitioning them seemed only natural. Fragments of old-world civilization will eventually fade into nothingness, becoming a dream that no one remembers.



## MC E - Out of Reach

The "Venus de Milo" artist collective renewed its appeal to the White Tower, advocating for the inclusion of history, literature, and art in educational curricula. However, this proposal has once again been firmly rejected.

The educational system of the old world is now regarded as a relic of the past, replaced by curricula that prioritize practicality and functionality. In this new era, the focus has pivoted to essential fields such as materials science, civil engineering, and medicine—deemed foundational for the resurrection of civilization. The White Tower posits that this pragmatic education addresses communal obligations and equips individuals with the necessary skills to navigate and endure the aftermath of cataclysms.

In the current era of crisis, the White Tower declared that the pursuit of understanding human history or fostering the ability to appreciate and create art and literature—those once-symbolic markers of "civilization"—no longer holds practical relevance. For entertainment, sports or portable emotion-regulation devices are undeniably more direct and efficient alternatives. And for emotional expression, where can these creations find their audience when most people in this era are indifferent to artistic works? Though filled with the creators' emotions and thoughts, exhibitions at La Fountain Inn are criticized for their esoteric nature and disconnected from daily life.

In this era dominated by efficiency and practical orientation, the armless Vénus seems incapable of embracing the future.
